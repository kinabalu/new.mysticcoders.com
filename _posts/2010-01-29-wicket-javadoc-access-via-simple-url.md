There are definitely times, that I wish I had easy access to the javadoc for something in the Wicket internals, without opening the IDE, or keeping my own local versions available.

I usually resort to a quick Google search and unfortunately 9 / 10 I get a non-recent javadoc version.

Today I've gone through and downloaded all the core library javadocs for Wicket and as of version 1.4.6 they are all available from the following link:

<a href="http://wicketbyexample.com/api">wicketbyexample.com/api</a>

Click through to the library you'd like and get immediate access.  It follows a simple structure /api/&lt;module name&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/

That's it.  Hope some of you find it useful.
