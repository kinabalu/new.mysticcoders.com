Bulgaria.

This year, as with every year was an amazing experience filled with rich technical content, amazing speakers and attendees delivering an awesome conference.  As promised, here are the presentations and information on the three presentations delivered this year.

<h3><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mysticweb-bucket/presentations/java2days_2012/The+HTML5+Landscape+-+java2days+2012.pdf">The HTML5 Landscape</a></h3>
This year, we showed some new demo items, along with layout for the HTML5 landscape talk.  From now forward, we'll add to the following repository
"<a href="https://github.com/kinabalu/html5demo">HTML5 Demo</a>" and add cool new demos as we have them.

<h3><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mysticweb-bucket/presentations/java2days_2012/Using+Javascript+to+Build+Native+iOS+Applications+-+java2days+2012.pdf">Using Javascript to Build Native iOS Applications</a></h3>
For the Javascript builds your iOS application talk, we built an example grabbing the current weather from <a href="http://openweathermap.org" rel="nofollow">Open Weather Map</a>.  Take a look at the repository "
<a href="https://github.com/kinabalu/mobileweather">MobileWeather Titanium</a>" and if you'd like to help spruce it up, let us know.

<h3><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mysticweb-bucket/presentations/java2days_2012/Advanced+techniques+for+mobile+games+with+HTML5+-+java2days+2012.pdf">Advanced techniques for mobile games with HTML5</a></h3>
This year, we were asked to co-present with one of the developers at <a href="http://www.cayetanogaming.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cayetanogaming.com</a>.  We advised the team on some ideas for how to organize, and also took over a large portion of the presentation to spice it up, and make it more fun.  On advisement Kristiyan from Cayetano built out a balloon shooting game available here: <a href="https://github.com/kinabalu/balloonshooter">Balloon Shooter</a>.

Thank you again for everyone who attended this year, and as always, feel free to contact me if you have questions about anything.
