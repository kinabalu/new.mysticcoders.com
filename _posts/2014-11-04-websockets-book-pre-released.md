![WebSocket book]({{site.url}}/images/websocket-book-comp.png)

We're nearing completion on writing a book for [O'Reilly][oreilly] about [WebSocket][websocket-oreilly].  The book will be released soon as currently [available in Early Release][websocket-oreilly] on the publisher's site.  It's been quite a ride taking the concept from a blank page, to over 150 pages of in-depth discussion about WebSocket and I'm totally excited to share it with you soon.  
<!--more-->

This is something we've never embarked on before.  Our main focus has always been offering tech solutions for business problems, giving trainings, and evangelizing and teaching technology in conferences worldwide.  Writing a book has been on the goal list for years now, and I'm grateful that I got the opportunity to do so with the team over at O'Reilly.

Special thanks go out to [Stephan Spencer][stephan_spencer] who helped push me into getting this thing done, and many others who cheerleaded along the way.

Here's a look at the table of contents:

* Chapter 1 - Quickstart
* Chapter 2 - WebSocket API
* Chapter 3 - Bidirectional Chat
* Chapter 4 - STOMP Over WebSocket
* Chapter 5 - WebSocket Compatibility
* Chapter 6 - WebSocket Security
* Chapter 7 - TBA
* Chapter 8 - WebSocket Protocol

Thank you to everyone involved, and please [buy the pre-release][websocket-oreilly] if you're interested, and learn about WebSocket technology today.
