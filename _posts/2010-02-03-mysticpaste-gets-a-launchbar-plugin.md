Our <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Wicket</a> based pastebin has gotten another plugin for pasting your content!  A lot of the folks at Mystic love the <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" target="_blank">Launchbar</a> product for navigating the filesystem, launching applications, searching, and much more.  

After perusing the forums for Launchbar a bit ago we came upon a post detailing an applescript for posting to another pastebin <a href="http://forums.obdev.at/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=3043" target="_blank">available here</a>.  We thought we'd modify the script to work for our pastebin and we've just released it and it is available now.

You can <a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste/tree/master/applescript-plugin/" target="_blank">download the script</a> and install it in <code>~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions</code>.

Please let us know if you have any trouble at all
