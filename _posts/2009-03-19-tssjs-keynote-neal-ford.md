The conference was kicked off with a great keynote speech by <a href="http://www.nealford.com/" title="Neal Ford" target="_blank">Neal Ford</a>. The presentation was â€œ<em><a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/sessions.html#NFordKeynote" target="_blank">Productive Programmer: On the Lam from the Furniture Police</a></em>â€ and was a subject near and dear to many developers who have ever worked in a cube farm, and wanted to squeeze more productivity out of your day. As â€œknowledge workersâ€ weâ€™re all expected to have enough focus to write useful code to get our projects to completion.

To that end, Nealâ€™s talk moved through the topicâ€™s range and discussed brain theory, the zone, and creating a healthy workspace.

A good portion of the talk was dedicated to the difference between the right brain and the left brain, and how both are useful in the task of software engineering. While most programmers have a fairly clear idea on how to get their left brain engaged in a task, the right brain, the creative brain, is somewhat of a mystery to most. Iâ€™ve done lots of work studying the mind and concur with the strategies laid out in Nealâ€™s talk. The aim in the first section was getting out of the right brain, those insights that hit us when weâ€™re *focused* on something else.

The following were discussed as good methods of distraction to receive your â€œA Ha!â€ moment, note they are repetitive tasks:

<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mowing the lawn</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Playing a puzzle-based game video/real</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Cooking</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" title="Pair Programming" target="_blank">Pair Programming</a> - the driver is engaging in left brain activity, the navigator is engaging in right brain activity</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The other issue with the right brain, is thoughts are fleeting, and you need some way to keep them from running off. Hereâ€™s where a â€œTrusted Systemâ€ to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" title="Getting Things Done" target="_blank">GTD</a> term comes into play. Whatever this is, the key is to use it, get it out of your brain, and engage with the data later. Examples of â€œTrusted Systemsâ€ include: Moleskin notebook, PIM, (insert anything that captures your thoughts here).</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Another area touched on which inhabits purely right brain activity was the idea of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" title="Mindmap" target="_blank">Mind Map</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Buzan" title="Tony Buzan" target="_blank">Tony Buzan</a> created this concept which basically consists of a brainstorm-like diagram with color, drawing, and linkage with single descriptive words. It simply maps the way a memory is already created in the mind. <a href="http://www.xmind.net/" title="XMind" target="_blank">XMind</a> or <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/" title="Mindmanager" target="_blank">MindManager</a> are popular tools to lay these out on a computer.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The final major area touched on was the idea of â€œFlowâ€. Getting into â€œThe Zoneâ€. Too often in our daily activity, the constant notifications and other applications vying for our attention distract us and pull us out of flow. A couple of applications discussed during the talk to help *dim out* any distractions:</span></strong>

<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/products/doodim/" rel="nofollow" title="doodim for mac" target="_blank">doodim</a> for mac</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/2006/09/day-10-jedi-concentrate.html" rel="nofollow" title="jedi concentrate" target="_blank">jedi concentrate</a> for windows</span></strong></li>
</ul>
Other suggestions talked about for keeping in the zone: automating repetitive tasks, kill environmental distractions, good chair, minimum of 2 monitors, and a VERY fast desktop. Neal put on a great keynote presentation, and I felt it was a great kickoff for this years symposium.
