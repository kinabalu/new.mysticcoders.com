So our little <a href="http://mysticpaste.com" target="_blank">pastebin</a> has been growing up lately!  After playing the staring role in <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2009/03/09/5-days-of-wicket/">5 days of Wicket</a> as an example project, it's been used as a public pastebin for almost two years.  So as with all older stars, it was in dire need of a facelift.

You can click through to the picture above to see the new pastebin.  Here is a quick list of some of the additions:

<ul>
<li>Implemented paste replies with automatic diff view + original</li>
<li>Original pastes will show all paste replies, and all paste replies have a link back to their original</li>
<li>Massive user interface clean up</li>
<li>Integrated SyntaxHighlighter 3.0</li>
<li>Implemented raw text view and download paste</li>
<li><a href="http://gradle.org" target="_blank">Gradle</a>-based build file (early testing)</li>
</ul>
Enjoy!
