Being a small business owner, I do a lot of talking on the phone.  It could be on the iPhone, but if I'm at the computer it's usually via <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a>.  I like to limit my usage of the mouse to as little as possible, so <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" target="_blank">Launchbar</a> is another absolute must.  Enter Skype Applescripts for Launchbar.

Simply do one of two things:

<ol>
<li>Select a contact record, and their phone number, &lt;tab&gt;, Call with Skype</li>
<li>Enter text entry mode ('), type in a phone number with or without country code info, &lt;tab&gt;, Call with Skype</li>
</ol>
Long ago, I got the Skype Scripts at the Launchbar forums, but it seems those links are gone now.  And the scripts that I had, for some reason didn't respect the country code and automatically assumed the US country code.  So entering something like +1 and then a number, would send +1+1 and then the number ... obviously Skype didn't think much of this.  Luckily through the power of the internet, I found a macosxhints article which in the comments had a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050810145110629" target="_blank">perfect replacement</a> for the "Call with Skype" script.  Here's the original forum posts over at the <a href="http://forums.obdev.at/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1288" target="_blank">Objective Development Forums</a>.

I've included an archive of the scripts, it should be placed at /Users/<Username>/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/Skype.  There are a handful of really awesome scripts aside from the "Call with Skype" including:

<ol>
<li>Answer Skype Call</li>
<li>Call with Skype</li>
<li>Decline Skype Call</li>
<li>Hang Up Skype Call</li>
<li>Skype Mute Off</li>
<li>Skype Mute On</li>
<li>Toggle Skype Mute</li>
<li>And many many more...</li>
</ol>
Enjoy!
