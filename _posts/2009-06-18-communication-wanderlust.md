The research on this is pretty conclusive. Itâ€™s common knowledge now: humans suck at multitasking.  We canâ€™t do it. Ever try to send an email while talking or listening on the phone?  While youâ€™re writing that gem of an email, youâ€™re ignoring the conversation.  Instead of doing one thing well, you end up doing two things half-assed.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-987"></a>

Communication is now seamlessly accessible. Traveling by plane was the one time you could be sure to ignore everything, including the Internet. Now even that security hold has been breached.  There are so many communication technologies, theyâ€™ve become more burden than benefit, but if any one thing should receive the lionâ€™s share of blame, itâ€™s email.

Several tricksters have devised methods of quelling this beastly problem. Back in 2004, Lawrence Lessig, the well-known Internet attorney, declared email bankruptcy, emptied his inbox and sent a mass email asking those with important unanswered emails to resend.  Tim Ferriss of The 4-Hour Work Week suggests an automated response letting people know you only check your email once a day.  You could read for hours on 43Folders.com about Inbox Zero software and other techniques for managing the communication overlordâ€¦oopsâ€¦I mean overload.  

Mobile phones have only contributed to attention-stealing options and now theyâ€™re â€œsmart.â€ Instead of merely phones, theyâ€™re now Internet communicators, portable music players, and oh yeah, if you need to make a call they can do that, too.  Best (or worst) of all, theyâ€™ll allow your email to follow you. Everywhere you go.

The truth is email suffers from an identity crisis because itâ€™s more snail-mail than instant communication. Email delivery speed creates an illusion where the sender expects a message immediately sent will be immediately read.  

In the end, whether you go extremist or not, hereâ€™s the most often cited tip: turn-off the recurring, automatic â€œGet Mailâ€ feature! Resist the urge to manually retrieve your email more than once or twice a day.  And make sure that important people know the surest way to reach you is by phone.

If more focus is what you want in life, when in doubt, go lo-fi.  Close your email program, turn off all IM-style chats, ignore text messages, Twitters, Facebook updates, and prepare for quiet.  When youâ€™d like to dip your attention back into the chaos, it will be there, waiting patiently for your return.
