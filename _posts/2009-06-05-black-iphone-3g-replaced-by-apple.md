Well, something in the cosmos seemed to change the situation from yesterday to today.  After blogging and sending some emails, I decided to call back AppleCare and plead my case again.  I spoke with an awesome product specialist Sara, and after listening to what happened, called down to "the same store" and ensured that when I arrived they would process and give me a new phone.

A little bit of persistence seems to pay off in big dividends.  Continually searching out for what happened, and how the matter could be resolved, it seems to have resolved itself nicely.

Thank you again to Apple for custom service that definitely went above and beyond, even if there was a hiccup before the beyond.
