I've been reading a copy of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-wicket-cookbook/book">Apache Wicket Cookbook</a> by Igor Vaynberg and will be posting a review soon.  Igor is one of the fantastic core developers for <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> and seems to have an amazing ability to crank out awesome code, and answer questions on the very active mailing list.  Apparently, he might be super human, and wrote a book in his "spare time".

Hats off to Igor, an amazing accomplishment.  Watch this space for a review.
