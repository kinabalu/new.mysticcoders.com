<a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/idea-lab/"><em>A full list of the ideas currently in the IdeaLab</em></a>

We bring our phones everywhere with us.  And more and more, for a lot of us, the iPad is replacing most conventional uses of a computer, and introducing new usages we weren't aware of years before.  With the advent of Yoga and other eastern teachings becoming mainstream, meditation is certainly a big focus and most don't know how to properly achieve this state.

Enter: Mobile Meditation.

The Idea: Your companion will help you achieve that meditative state.  With a pair of headphones, and many different programs to select from, zen is just a couple of taps away.

The How:

1. Include several (public domain) pieces of soothing music designed to induce trance for easier meditation.
2. A timer at a configurable time to gently bring you out of the meditative state
3. Ability to use your own music from your iTunes library during meditation
4. For larger format screens like the iPad, offer the ability to use a slideshow of chosen images to play during the meditation

Another possibility is for in-app purchases of some famous voices helping you achieve trance.  Deepak Chopra, The Dalai Lama, and many others are certainly possible here.  In addition, this can be useful as a morning ritual to pump you up for the day rather than clear the mind.  The inspirational speech given in the movie "Any Given Sunday" being one example, or anything by Vince Lombardi, Anthony Robbins, etc.
