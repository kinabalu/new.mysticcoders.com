We just finished up a little blog post talking about upgrading the sample app from <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2009/03/09/5-days-of-wicket/">5 Days of Wicket</a> to Wicket 1.4 which was just released.  Learn about a simple <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2009/07/31/after-the-5-days-of-wicket-upgrading-to-wicket-14/">conversion to 1.4 of MysticPaste.com</a> on <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog">Mystic's blog</a>.  We review some of our findings:

<ul>
<li>Generify everything for the most benefit</li>
<li>Deprecated classes now exist making some of your code obsolete</li>
<li>Some configuration changes and libraries move around</li>
</ul>
Overall the process of upgrading took a little under 30 minutes, and for a medium to large code base probably would take a little less than a day from estimates we're hearing.
