I realize this post is over 2 1/2 months past the actual event, but it was such an awesome time with the <a href="http://mysticcoders.com/" title="mystic coders - to our success!">Mystic</a> crew, I thought I'd share a bit of the day.


First off, several flew in the night before, and enjoyed a bit of <a href="http://vegas.com" title="Vegas baby" target="_blank">Vegas</a> before the official festivities. Two of the folks in our team had never been to <a href="http://vegas.com" title="Vegas baby" target="_blank">Vegas</a> before, so it was an especially interesting experience. Mystic put everyone up for the night at the <a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/" title="Mandalay Bay" target="_blank">Mandalay Bay</a>, a fantastic hotel and one of the few I'd recommend staying in <a href="http://vegas.com" title="Vegas baby" target="_blank">Vegas</a>.

We started on Saturday at around noon, had some lunch brought up to my suite, and started rapping with my good friend John Catalina. John is an amazing energy that I hired on with <a href="http://mysticcoders.com/" title="mystic coders - to our success!">Mystic</a> several years ago and helped to catapult us to heights we had not yet imagined. After a short break, we got down to business talk, my vision for the company, and how we can continue to get there. Lots of great ideas came out of this session, about 4 hours in total, and we've been integrating the ideas for the last few months and starting to see our master plan in action.


Hyped from some great work earlier in the day, <a href="http://mysticcoders.com/" title="mystic coders - to our success!">Mystic</a> treated everyone to dinner at <a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/dining/redsquare.aspx" title="Red Square - Las Vegas" target="_blank">Red Square</a>. It's an obvious Russian themed bar / restaurant, so any drink had must have some vodka in it, so we chose Chernobyl, which had 4+ shots of various Vodka's in a cranberry juice on the rocks.

Nice and full from the evening dinner, we headed off to the entertainment, <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/" title="Penn &amp; Teller" target="_blank">Penn &amp; Teller</a>, who put on a fabulous show at the Rio.

We all laughed and marveled at the magic, and ever the teachers, the explanations they gave for a good portion of the performance. The one thing I will say is, Penn seems to have a soapbox behind the stage which turns out is why he is so tall :-).


All in all the most trouble of the night, was getting back to the hotel, which usually aside from some Vegas traffic, isn't a big deal. The Vegas marathon was the next morning, so some brainchild decided it would be a good idea to shutdown Las Vegas Blvd and several other routes back to the attractions^Hhotels in <a href="http://vegas.com" title="Vegas baby" target="_blank">Vegas</a>.


The <a href="http://mysticcoders.com/" title="mystic coders - to our success!">Mystic</a> offsite is destined to be the first of many, and I just wanted to thank the rest of the team for making it an awesome experience!
