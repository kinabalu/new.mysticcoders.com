That's right folks, we've again taken the love for <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> on the road to Ft Lauderdale, Florida!  The team that puts on these shows is the same that does the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tours around the USA.  This show though, and &Uuml;berconf before it are all about longer more in-depth sessions so you leave knowing how to get started, and workshopping with the speakers and deep diving into actually building with that technology.

We had a great group enthused about Apache Wicket, some trying it for the first time, and others already fans with some laser-guided questions for how to get more out of the framework.  

Here are links as references for the folks who were unable to attend and those who asked them to reposted:
