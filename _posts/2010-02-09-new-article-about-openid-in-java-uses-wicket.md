Last week  I was searching  examples while working in integrating OpenID in a Java Web Applications and I found a very recent article (January 27th) on the IBM developerWorks.
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-openid/index.html"></a>

<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-openid/index.html">OpenID for Java Web applications, Part 1</a> by J Steven Perry offer a panoramic about OpenID in a modern web applications and uses Apache Wicket as Web framework for the example. The article is really good and offers the whole source code as download.

This article talk about implementing an OpenID consumer Service while the part two will focus on writing an OpenID provider.
