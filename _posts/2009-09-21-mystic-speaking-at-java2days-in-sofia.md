Andrew Lombardi, head geek around here will be speaking at <a href="http://java2days.com" target="_blank">Java2Days</a> in Sofia, Bulgaria on October 8th - 9th, 2009!  We'll be talking about delving into Apache Wicket for the first time, and cover an actual application and look at real source code.  In addition we'll be giving a more advanced talk covering custom components, models, ajax, and integration with 3rd party libraries (namely javascript).

If you're in the area, or will be at the conference, make sure to stop by and say hello!
