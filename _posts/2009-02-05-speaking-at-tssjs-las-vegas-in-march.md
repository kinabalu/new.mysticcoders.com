So on March 20th, I'll be in Vegas, Caesar's Palace to speak to some peeps about <a title="Apache Wicket" href="http://wicket.apache.org">Wicket</a> for <a title="Architecting Applications using Apache Wicket - Andrew Lombardi" href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/frameworks.html#ALombardiWicket">The Server Side Java Symposium</a>. The official topic is "Architecting Applications using Apache Wicket". I've been busy researching other presentations, and preparing my own, so I can represent <a title="mystic coders - to our success!" href="http://mysticcoders.com/">Mystic</a> well.

Get your butt over to Vegas in March for the conference, it runs the 18th through the 20th.

And remember: always bet on <a title="mystic coders - to our success!" href="http://mysticcoders.com/">mystic</a>.
